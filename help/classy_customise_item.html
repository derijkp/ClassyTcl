<h1>Customise item dialog</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The customise dialog can usually be called from the File menu, by invoking
an entry labeled "Customise <something>".
It can be used to edit, delete or create configuration files in Peos. 
<p>
Editing configuration files allows customisation of the way the
application works. Things such as key-shortcuts, colors and fonts can be 
easily changed. At startup, a Peos application will search 
several places for configuration files, making it possible to eg. to change the 
configuration for either all Peos applications or for one specific application, 
for all users (global) or just one specific user (personal), or even one startup 
directory (local).  The configuration dialog box lists a button for each possible 
configuration file in the order they will be checked (Application specific configuration
options will only show the application specific configurations):
 
<dl>
<dt>Local application specific configuration
<dd>This is the most specific configuration file. If this configuration file is 
created, it will only be used if the current application is started 
in the current directory. Another application started in the same directory or the 
same application started in another directory will not see or use this file.
The file is stored in the directory .peosconf/&lt;application name&gt; (or 
equivalent depending on OS) in the startup directory.
<dt>Personal application specific configuration
<dd>This configuration file is specific to the current user (Unix) and application.
This will be used if present, and if no local configuration is found (see above). 
Other users will not find this configuration. The file is stored in the 
directory .peosconf/&lt;application name&gt; (or equivalent depending on OS) in 
the home directory of the user.
<dt>Global application specific configuration
<dd>application specific configuration stored in the conf sub directory of the 
application directory.
<dt>Local configuration
<dd>This configuration file will be seen by any Peos application starting up in
the current directory. (Whether it will be used depends on whether more specific
configurations are present.)
The file is stored in the directory .peosconf/peos (or equivalent depending on OS) 
in the startup directory.
<dt>Personal configuration
<dd>personal configuration for any Peos application. The file is stored in the 
directory .peosconf/peos (or equivalent depending on OS) in the home directory of 
the user.
<dt>Global configuration
<dd>This is the most generic configuration file. If no other is found, this one is used.
It should never be deleted.
</dl>
<p>
If a configuration file actually exists, the mark before the button is checked. 
A possible configuration can be selected (indicated by a pressed in and differently 
colored button) for editing or creation by clicking it. 

<h2>Named configurations</h2>
Configuration can be named. Named configurations are never seen by a Peos application
at startup, but can be used to store several possible configurations, wich can be 
restored easily afterwards by using the "Create" button.
<p>
The <a href="peos_entry.html">entry</a> labeled "Named" gives access to create, 
edit or delete named configuration files. Typing the name in the entry, en pressing 
enter, will list the different possibilities for the configurations with this name.
The name can also be selected out of all currently available names using the default
mechanism (click the arrow button).
