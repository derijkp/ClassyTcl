<h1>Defaults</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
An entry can have several default values. Clicking the down arrow to the right of the 
entry will present a dialogue box with a list of these defaults. Clicking (or releasing
the pointer over) one of them, puts this one into the entry. Action buttons to add or 
remove defaults from the list are also present. Specific defaults can be saved on
a user or global basis.
