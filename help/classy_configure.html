<h1>The configuration system</h1>

<h2>Configuration system</h2>
The Configuration system is used to change the ClassyTcl configuration 
settings. Keys, mousebuttons, fonts, colors, menus, toolbars and some 
general settings can be changed.
<p>
Configuration can be changed at different levels, making it possible to eg. to change the 
configuration for either all ClassyTcl applications or for one specific application, 
for all users (global) or just one specific user (personal). 
At startup, a ClassyTcl application will parse different levels in the following 
order:
<ol>
<li><b>ClassyTcl default (def)</b>: Global configuration settings
<dd>
This level contains the most general configuration settings. They apply to any ClassyTcl 
application, and should never be deleted. However, they can be overruled by any of the other 
levels. (The configuration files for this level are stored in the conf/init subdirectory of 
the ClassyTcl installation directory.)
<li><b>ClassyTcl user (user)</b>: Personal configuration
<dd>
Settings at this level overrule the global, default settings for a particular user.
The configuration id stored in the directory .classy/init (or equivalent depending on OS) 
in the home directory of the user.
<li><b>Application Default (appdef)</b>: Global application specific configuration
<dd>
Settings at this level overrule the global, default settings for a particular application.
The configuration is stored in files in the conf/init subdirectory of the 
application directory.
<li><b>Application user (appuser)</b>: Personal application specific configuration
<dd>
These configuration  settings are specific to the current user (Unix) and application.
Settings at this level will overrule any other settings for that appliction and user.
The settings are stored in the subdirectory .classy-apps/&lt;application name&gt;/init of the users home 
directory (or equivalent depending on OS). 
</ol>
<p>

<h2>Named configurations</h2>
Named configurations can be used to store several possible configurations (eg. blue or 
gray color style, Unix or Windows keys), wich can be selected easily afterwards by using 
the "Select configuration" button. Named configurations can also be saved at
different levels.

<h2>The configuration dialogs</h2>
The main part of a configuration dialog is the individual configuration window.
The contents of this window depends on what is being configured. However, all 
configuration windows contain an optionmenu showing the location of the current 
configuration item and a button bar with the following buttons:
<ul>
<li><b>Save</b>: save the current settings
<li><b>SaveAs</b>: save the current settings on a different level, or as a named configuration
<li><b>Use</b>: use the currently being edited settings
<li><b>Select</b>: select the settings from another level or named configuration
<li><b>Clear</b>: set all settings to use default
<li><b>Reconfigure</b>: go through the normal configuration initialisation.
<li><b>Restore</b>: reset currently being edited settings to those in the file
<li><b>Help</b>: show this help text
<li><b>Close</b>: close the dialog
</ul>
<p>
The general configuration dialog can usually be called from the File menu, by invoking 
an entry labeled "Configure". (The Tcl command to popup the dialog 
is "Classy::Config dialog".) 
It shows a tree with the different configuration levels, 
and the things that can be configured on that level, next the individual
configuration window in which changes to the selected configuration block can be made.
