<h1>Configuration dialog</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The Configuration dialog is used to change the ClassyTcl configuration 
settings. From this dialog keys, mousebuttons, fonts, colors, menus, toolbars and some 
general settings can be configured. The configure dialog can usually be 
called from the File menu, by invoking an entry labeled "Configure".

<h2>The configuration system</h2>
Configuration can be changed at different levels, making it possible to eg. to change the 
configuration for either all ClassyTcl applications or for one specific application, 
for all users (global) or just one specific user (personal). 
At startup, a ClassyTcl application will parse different levels in the following 
order:

<ol>
<li><b>ClassyTcl default (def)</b>: Global configuration settings
<dd>
This level contains the most general configuration settings. They apply to any ClassyTcl 
application, and should never be deleted. However, they can be overruled by any of the other 
levels. (The configuration files for this level are stored in the conf/init subdirectory of 
the ClassyTcl installation directory.)
<li><b>ClassyTcl user (user)</b>: Personal configuration
<dd>
Settings at this level overrule the global, default settings for a particular user.
The configuration id stored in the directory .classy/init (or equivalent depending on OS) 
in the home directory of the user.
<li><b>Application Default (appdef)</b>: Global application specific configuration
<dd>
Settings at this level overrule the global, default settings for a particular application.
The configuration is stored in in files in the conf/init subdirectory of the 
application directory.
<li><b>Application user (appuser)</b>: Personal application specific configuration
<dd>
These configuration  settings are specific to the current user (Unix) and application.
Settings at this level will overrule any other settings.
The settings are stored in the subdirectory /.&lt;application name&gt;/init of the users home 
directory (or equivalent depending on OS). 
</ol>

<h2>Named configurations</h2>
Named configurations can be used to store several possible configurations (eg. blue or 
gray color style, Unix or Windows keys), wich can be selected easily afterwards by using 
the "Select configuration" button. Named configurations can also be saved at
different levels.
