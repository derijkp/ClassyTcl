<h1>The configuration system</h1>

<h2>Configuration system</h2>
The Configuration system is used to change the ClassyTcl configuration 
settings. Keys, mousebuttons, fonts, colors, <a href="classy_dynamenu.html">menu</a> and 
<a href="classy_dynatool.html">toolbar definitions</a> and some 
general settings can be changed. 
<p>
Configuration can be changed at different levels, making it possible to eg. to change the 
configuration for either all ClassyTcl applications or for one specific application, 
for all users (global) or just one specific user (personal). 
At startup, a ClassyTcl application will parse the settings in the different levels in the following 
order:
<ol>
<li><b>Default (def)</b>: Global ClassyTcl default settings
<br>
This level contains the most general configuration settings. They apply to any ClassyTcl 
application, and should never be deleted. However, they can be overruled by any of the other 
levels. (The configuration files for this level are stored in the file init.conf  in the conf 
subdirectory of the ClassyTcl installation directory. Icons are stored in the corresponding 
conf/icons subdirectory.)
<li><b>User (user)</b>: Personal ClassyTcl settings
<br>
Settings at this level overrule the default settings for a particular user.
The settings are stored in the file .classy/init.conf (or equivalent depending on OS) 
in the home directory of the user. Icons are stored in the corresponding 
.classy/icons subdirectory.
<li><b>Application (appdef)</b>: Global application specific settings
<br>
Settings at this level overrule the default settings for a particular application.
The configuration is stored in files in the file conf/init.conf of the 
application directory. Icons are stored in the corresponding conf/icons subdirectory.
<li><b>Final (appuser)</b>: Personal application specific settings<br>
These configuration  settings are specific to the current user (Unix) and application.
Settings at this level will overrule any other settings for that appliction and user.
The settings are stored in the file .classy-apps/&lt;application name&gt;/init.conf of 
the users home directory (or equivalent depending on OS).  Icons are stored in the corresponding 
.classy-apps/&lt;application name&gt;/icons subdirectory.
</ol>

<h2>Icons</h2>
Icons cannot be changed from the Configuration dialog yet,
but they can be changed by replacing the files in the icon configuration directories in the 
different levels. Icons are searched by name, starting at the appuser level, followed by the 
appdef, user and def levels. (Icons are retrieved using the command "Classy::geticon iconname".)

<h2>Themes</h2>
A theme is a file that contains a collection of configuration settings (eg. blue or 
gray color style, Unix or Windows keys) that can be loaded into the 
currently selected level using the "load" button and created using the "saveAs" button.. 

<h2>The configuration dialogs</h2>
The configuration dialog consists of a tree which represents all possible configuration
settings, and a pane where a selected setting can be changed. At the top the current level
can be selected. Under this is a button with the following buttons:
<ul>
<li><b>test</b>: change the settings of the running application to the current settings
<li><b>Save</b>: save the current settings
<li><b>SaveAs</b>: save the current settings as a theme
<li><b>load</b>: load a theme into the current level
<li><b>reset</b>: reset to the settings in the configuration files
<li><b>clear level</b>: clears the settings at the current level. This
will cause the settings of one of the lower levels to be used.
<li><b>Advanved Edit</b>: pops up a dialog from which new configuration settings (nodes) can be added, 
or existing ones can be deleted. Descriptions and actual keys can also be changed.
<li><b>Help</b>: show this help text
<li><b>Close</b>: close the dialog
</ul>
<p>
The general configuration dialog can usually be called from the File menu, by invoking 
an entry labeled "Customise". (The Tcl command to popup the configuration dialog 
is "Classy::Config dialog". The option -node can be used to open the configuration dialog at
a certain node.)
