<h1>The configuration system</h1>

<h2>Configuration system</h2>
The Configuration system is used to change the ClassyTcl configuration 
settings. Keys, mousebuttons, fonts, colors, <a href="classy_dynamenu.html">menu</a> and 
<a href="classy_dynatool.html">toolbar definitions</a> and some 
general settings can be changed. 
<p>
Configuration can be changed at different levels, making it possible to eg. to change the 
configuration for either all ClassyTcl applications or for one specific application, 
for all users (Default) or just one specific user (personal). 
At startup, a ClassyTcl application will parse the settings in the different levels in the following 
order:
<ol>

<li><b>Default ClassyTcl settings</b> (def)
<br>
This level contains the most general configuration settings. They apply to any ClassyTcl 
application, and should never be deleted. However, they can be overruled by any of the other 
levels. (The configuration files for this level are stored in the conf subdirectory of 
the ClassyTcl installation directory. Most settings are in the file conf.values. Icons,menus
and toolbars are stored in the corresponding conf/icons, conf/menu and conf/toolbar subdirectory.)

<li><b>User  ClassyTcl settings</b> (user)
<br>
Settings at this level overrule the default settings for a particular user.
The settings are stored in the subdirector .classy (or equivalent depending on OS) 
of the home directory of the user.

<li><b>Default application settings</b> (appdef)
<br>
Settings at this level overrule the default settings for a particular application.
The configuration is stored in files in the subdirectory conf of the 
application directory.

<li><b>User application settings</b> (appuser)
These configuration  settings are specific to the current user (Unix) and application.
Settings at this level will overrule any other settings for that appliction and user.
The settings are stored in the subdirectory .classy-apps/&lt;application name&gt; of 
the users home directory (or equivalent depending on OS).
</ol>

<h2>Icons</h2>
Icons cannot be changed from the Configuration dialog yet,
but they can be changed by replacing the files in the icon configuration directories in the 
different levels. Icons are searched by name, starting at the appuser level, followed by the 
appdef, user and def levels. (Icons are retrieved using the command "Classy::geticon iconname".)

<h2>Themes</h2>
A theme is a file that contains a collection of configuration settings (eg. blue or 
gray color style, Unix or Windows keys) that can be loaded into the 
currently selected level using the "Themes" button and created using the "Save As" button.. 

<h2>The configuration dialog</h2>
The configuration dialog consists of a notebook which presents all possible configuration
settings in a hierarchy. A list of settings in the current hierarchy and a pane where a 
selected setting can be changed is shown. At the bottom of this pane are the 
following buttons:
<ul>
<li><b>Default entry</b>: Clear the setting for the currently selected entry. A default value
(from previous levels) will be used instead.
<li><b>Default list</b>: Clear the settings for all entries in the list shown.
<li><b>Default all</b>: Clear the settings for all configuration entries (at this level).
<li><b>Reset entry</b>: Reset the value of the current entry to the original value
<li><b>Reset list</b>: Reset the settings for all entries in the list shown.
<li><b>Reset all</b>: Reset the settings for all configuration entries (at this level).
</ul>
<p>
The dialog box has the following buttons:
<ul>
<li><b>Save</b>: save the current settings (at the current level)
<li><b>Apply</b>: change the settings of the running application to the current settings
<li><b>Themes</b>: Pop up the <a href="classy_config_themes.html">theme selection dialog box</a>
<li><b>Save As</b>: save the current settings as a theme using the <a href="classy_config_saveas.html">save configuration as dialog box</a>
<li><b>Select level</b>: Select the current configuration level
<li><b>Help</b>: show this help text
<li><b>Close</b>: close the dialog
</ul>
<p>
The general configuration dialog can usually be called from the File menu, by invoking 
an entry labeled "Customise". (The Tcl command to popup the configuration dialog 
is "Classy::Config dialog". The option -node can be used to open the configuration dialog at
a certain node.)
