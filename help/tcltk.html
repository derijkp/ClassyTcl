<h1>What are Tcl and Tk</h1>

Tcl and Tk originated with <b>Dr. John Ousterhout</b> (Oh'-stir-hout - last syllable 
rhymes with rout, not root) from the University of California, Berkeley, California, 
now working for Sun.
<p>
<b>Tcl</b> (current release version 8.0) stands for ``tool command language'' and is pronounced
``tickle.'' More information about Tcl can be found on the WWW site of the authors:
<a href="http://www.scriptics.com/">www.scriptics.com</a>.
<p>
Tcl is actually two things: a language and a library. First, Tcl is a <b>simple textual language</b>, 
intended primarily for issuing commands to interactive programs such as text editors, debuggers, 
illustrators, and shells. It has a simple syntax and is also programmable, so Tcl users can write 
command procedures to provide more powerful commands than those in the built-in set.
<p>
Second, Tcl is a <b>library package</b> that can be embedded in application programs. 
The Tcl library consists of a parser for the Tcl language, routines to implement the 
Tcl built-in commands, and procedures that allow each application to extend Tcl with 
additional commands specific to that application. The application program generates Tcl 
commands and passes them to the Tcl parser for execution. Commands may be generated by 
reading characters from an input source, or by associating command strings with elements 
of the application's user interface, such as menu entries, buttons, or keystrokes. When 
the Tcl library receives commands it parses them into component fields and executes 
built-in commands directly. For commands implemented by the application, Tcl calls back
to the application to execute the commands. In many cases commands will invoke recursive
invocations of the Tcl interpreter by passing in additional strings to execute (procedures,
looping commands, and conditional commands all work in this way).
<p>

An application program gains three <b>advantages by using Tcl</b> for its command 
language. First, Tcl provides a standard syntax: once users know Tcl, they will be able 
to issue commands easily to any Tcl-based application. Second, Tcl provides 
programmability. All a Tcl application needs to do is to implement a few 
application-specific low-level commands. Tcl provides many utility commands plus a 
general programming interface for building up complex command procedures. By using 
Tcl, applications need not re-implement these features. Third, extensions to Tcl, 
such as the Tk toolkit, provide mechanisms for communicating between applications by 
sending Tcl commands back and forth. The common Tcl language framework makes it easier 
for applications to communicate with one another. 

<p>
<b>Tk (current release 8.0)</b> - an extension to Tcl which provides the programmer with 
an interface to the X11 windowing system. The author's home ftp site for the Tk source is 
allspice.berkeley.edu. Note that many users will encounter Tk via the ``wish'' 
command. Wish is a simple windowing shell which permits the user to write Tcl 
applications in a prototyping environment. 

<h2>Newsgroup</h2>
 Tcl/Tk has its own newsgroup. It is called <b>comp.lang.tcl</b>.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
Lots of info about Tcl can be found in the Tcl FAQ. It is avaiable from
<a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu:80/hypertext/faq/usenet/tcl-faq/top.html">
http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu:80/hypertext/faq/usenet/tcl-faq/top.html</a>
Many FAQs, including this one, are available on the archive site 
rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news/answers . The name under which a FAQ is archived 
appears in the Archive-name line at the top of the article. For example, this part of the 
comp.lang.tcl FAQ is archived as
