<h1>What are Tcl and Tk</h1>

Tcl and Tk originated with <b>Dr. John Ousterhout</b> (Oh'-stir-hout - last syllable 
rhymes with rout, not root) from the University of California, Berkeley, California, 
now working for Sun.
<p>
<b>Tcl</b> (current release version 7.6) stands for ``tool command language'' and is pronounced ``tickle.'' The author's home ftp site for the Tcl source code is allspice.berkeley.edu.  Tcl is actually two things: a language and a library.  First, Tcl is a <b>simple textual language</b>, intended primarily for issuing commands to interactive programs such as text editors, debuggers, illustrators, and shells.  It has a simple syntax and is also programmable, so Tcl users can write command procedures to provide more powerful commands than those in the built-in set.
<p>
Second, Tcl is a <b>library package</b> that can be embedded in application programs.  The Tcl library consists of a parser for the Tcl language, routines to implement the Tcl built-in commands, and procedures that allow each application to extend Tcl with additional commands specific to that application.  The application program generates Tcl commands and passes them to the Tcl parser for execution.  Commands may be generated by reading characters from an input source, or by associating command strings with elements of the application's user interface, such as menu entries, buttons, or keystrokes.  When the Tcl library receives commands it parses them into component fields and executes built-in commands directly.  For commands implemented by the application, Tcl calls back to the application to execute the commands.  In many cases commands will invoke recursive invocations of the Tcl interpreter by passing in additional strings to execute (procedures, looping commands, and conditional commands all work in this way).
<p>
An application program gains three <b>advantages by using Tcl</b> for its command language.  First, Tcl provides a standard syntax:  once users know Tcl, they will be able to issue commands easily to any Tcl-based application.  Second, Tcl provides programmability.  All a Tcl application needs to do is to implement a few application-specific low-level commands.  Tcl provides many utility commands plus a general programming interface for building up complex command procedures.  By using Tcl, applications need not re-implement these features.  Third, extensions to Tcl, such as the Tk toolkit, provide mechanisms for communicating between applications by sending Tcl commands back and forth.  The common Tcl language framework makes it easier for applications to communicate with one another.
<p>
<b>Tk (current release 4.2)</b> - an extension to Tcl which provides the programmer with an interface to the X11 windowing system.  The author's home ftp site for the Tk source is allspice.berkeley.edu. Note that many users will encounter Tk via the ``wish'' command.  Wish is a simple windowing shell which permits the user to write Tcl applications in a prototyping environment.
<p>
<b>Extended Tcl (tclX)</b> (Version 7.3a) - This is an extended set of commands for Tcl developed by Karl Lehenbauer and Mark Diekhans.  The authors' home ftp site for Extended Tcl is ftp.neosoft.com.  Extended Tcl is oriented towards system programming tasks, with many additional interfaces to the Unix operating system along with other useful utilities.

<h2>Newsgroup</h2>
 Tcl/Tk has its own newsgroup. It is called <b>comp.lang.tcl</b>.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
Lots of info about Tcl can be found in the Tcl FAQ. It is avaiable at <b>harbor.ecn.purdue.edu:/pub/tcl/docs/tcl-faq.p0[1-5]</b>.
<p>
Many FAQs, including this one, are available on the archive site rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news/answers .  The name under which a FAQ is archived appears in the Archive-name line at the top of the article.  For example, this part of the comp.lang.tcl FAQ is archived as rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news/answers/tcl-faq/part1.Z .
<p>
There is also a mail server from which you can obtain a copy of the FAQ.  Send an email message to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu or archive-server@nic.switch.ch) with the word help in the body of the message to find out how to use it.
<p>
Also, this FAQ is available from within gopher (by looking at any one of the gopher holes presenting news.answers or FAQ lists), from WAIS servers (such as the comp.lang.tcl.src), and probably other resources as well.  Let me know when you find the FAQ in new and unusual locations so I can update this resource guide!

A great new resource access point for the FAQ is WorldWideWeb. The Uniform Resource Locator id for the FAQ is:
