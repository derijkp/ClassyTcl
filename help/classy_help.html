<H1>ClassyTcl Help system</H1>
The <a href="ClassyTcl.html">ClassyTcl</a> Help system uses hypertext as its basis. This is text in which some
words or paragraphs link to other texts, containing a description of or more 
information about the word. These links are usually shown in another color,
and clicking on them will fetch the linked text. All Help text are written in
HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which is also used on the WWW (World Wide Web).
<p>
Actually the help system can be used as a simple web browser. Help text can contain 
links to websites; the HTML parser is based on the 
<a href="../html_library-0.3/html/help.html">Tcl html library by Stephen Uhler</a> 
and understands HTML 2.0. You can go to any external site (if you are connected to 
the net) by selecting the File radiobutton in the Help toolbar, typing in the full 
url name in the entry, and pressing Return.
