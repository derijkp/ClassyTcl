<h1>cbuild file selection dialog</h1>

You started the ClassyTcl Builder without an application argument. The builder needs
to know which application you want to edit, so you can select one in this 
<a href="classy_file_select.html">file dialog</a>.
If you want to create a new application, just select a directory, and type in the 
name you want to give your new masterpiece. It will be created before the builder starts.
