<h1>
Class
</h1>

 The class named Class forms the basis of the 
 <a href="../classy_object_system.html">ClassyTcl object system</a>. It is the
 superclass of all classes and object in ClassyTcl.
 Class provides the functionality to produce classes and objects. Class 
 will normally not be used by itself to create objects.

<h2>
 Classmethods
</h2>
 The classmethods defined by Class can be invoked from all classes.
<dl><b><dt>
 ClassName new <u>object</u> ?...?
</b><dd>
 create a new instance (or object) with the name $<u>object</u> of class 
 ClassName. When the actual object is created,
 the init function of class ClassName will be invoked with the arguments
 given after $<u>object</u>.<br>
 Usually, the init method of the superclass
 must be invoked somehere in the init method with appropriate parameters.
 This can be done using the command 
<pre>super init ?...?</pre>.
<b><dt>
 ClassName subclass <u>SubClass</u>
</b><dd>
 create a new class named $<u>SubClass</u> that inherits data
 and methods from class ClassName. ClassName is the parent or
 superclass of SubClass.
<b><dt>
 Classname destroy
</b><dd>
 destroys a class. All its instances and subclasses and their
 instances will also be destroyed. If the classmethod destroy
 if defined for the class, it will be invoked after the 
 desctruction of its children, but before destroying the class
 itself and and its instances.
<b><dt>
 ClassName parent
</b><dd>
 returns the name of the superclass or parent of the class ClassName.
<b><dt>
 ClassName children
</b><dd>
 returns the names of all children of the class ClassName.
 These include all instances and all direct subclasses of ClassName.
<b><dt>
 ClassName method <u>name</u> <u>args</u> <u>body</u>
</b><dd>
 define a new method named $<u>name</u> for class ClassName.
 Whenever the method is invoked, the contents of body will be executed.
 The arguments <u>args</u> and <u>body</u> follow the same conventions
 as in the Tcl command proc.
<br>
 In body two extra local variables are available named class and object.
 They contain the name of respectively the class and the object that
 invoked the method. If the method was invoked from a class, the values
 of variables class and object will be identical (name of the class).
<b><dt>
 ClassName classmethod <u>name</u> <u>args</u> <u>body</u>
</b><dd>
 define a new classmethod named $<u>name</u> for class ClassName.
 Whenever the classmethod is invoked, the contents of body will be executed.
 The arguments <u>args</u> and <u>body</u> follow the same conventions
 as in the Tcl command proc.
<br>
 In body two extra local variables are available named class and object.
 Because a classmethod can only be invoked from a class, they are both
 contain the name of the class that invoked the method.
<b><dt>
 ClassName deletemethod <u>name</u>
</b><dd>
 delete the method named $<u>name</u> from class ClassName.
 Some special methods cannot be deleted.
<b><dt>
 ClassName deleteclassmethod <u>name</u>
</b><dd>
 delete the classmethod named $<u>name</u> from class ClassName.
 Some special classmethods cannot be deleted.
<b><dt>
 ClassName private ?<u>name</u>? ?<u>value</u>?
</b><dd>
 classmethod private is used to get or change private data 
 associated with a class.
 Without arguments a list of all private class variables is returned.
 If the name argument is given, but not the value argument, the 
 current value of private class variable $<u>name</u> is returned. If both arguments
 are present, the private class variable $<u>name</u> is set to $<u>value</u>.

</dl><h2>
 Methods
</h2>
 The methods defined by Class can be invoked from all objects.
<dl><b><dt>
 pathName destroy
</b><dd>
 destroys an object.
 The destroy method of the objects class (if defined) and those
 of its superclasses (if defined) will be invoked before the 
 destruction of the actual object.
<b><dt>
 pathName info <u>option</u> ?...?
</b><dd>
<b>pathName info class</b><br>
 returns the class of pathName<br>
<b>pathName info classmethods ?pattern?</b><br>
 returns a list of all available classmethods except the hidden ones (those starting 
 with an underscore is returned. When it is invoked with one argument, a list
 of all classmethods matching the pattern is returned<br>
<b>pathName info methods ?pattern?</b><br>
 returns a list of all available methods except the hidden methods (those starting 
 with an underscore is returned. When it is invoked with one argument, a list
 of all methods matching the pattern is returned<br>
<b>pathName info parent</b><br>
 returns the parent of pathName<br>
<b>pathName info children</b><br>
 returns the children of pathName<br>
<b>pathName info subclasses</b><br>
 returns the subclasses pathName<br>
<b>pathName info classmethod option name ...</b><br>
 returns information about the classmethod $name of pathName. Following options are supported:
<ul>
<li> body: returns the body of the classmethod (if it is defined in Tcl)
<li> args: returns the arguments of the classmethod
<li> default arg varname: returns 0 if the argument $arg does not have a default value, 
 otherwise it returns 1, and places the default value in the variable varname
</ul>
<br><b>pathName info method option name ...</b><br>
 returns information about the method $name of pathName. It takes the same options 
 as "info classmethod"
<b><dt>
 pathName private ?<u>name</u>? ?<u>value</u>?
</b><dd>
 private is used to get or change data associated with an object.
 Without arguments a list of all private variables is returned.
 If the name argument is given, but not the value argument, the 
 current value of private variable $<u>name</u> is returned. If both arguments
 are present, the private variable $<u>name</u> is set to $<u>value</u>.
