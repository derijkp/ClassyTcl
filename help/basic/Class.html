Class

 The class named Class is the basis of all classes and object in ClassyTcl.
 Class provides the functionality to produce classes and objects. Class 
 will normally not be used by itself to create objects.

<h2>
	Introduction
</h2>
 <h3>Classes and objects</h3>
 In ClassyTcl classes and objects are very similar: they are both 
 entities that combine data and methods (actions that can be performed).
 However, classes are usually used as a template to produce a number
 of objects or instances. The class of an object determines wich
 data it stores, and which methods it has available.<p>
 New classes can be created by subclassing existing classes. The subclass
 inherits the data and methods of its parent class. Extra data and methods
 can be added after the new class is created. Inherited methods can be
 replaced or removed.<p>
 When the package ClassyTcl is loaded, it will create one base class 
 named Class. All other classes and object will be derived from this
 base class.<p>

 <h3>Classmethods and methods</h3>
 Class provides two types of methods:
<dl>
<dt>classmethods
<dd>
 A classmethod is a command associated with a class.
 A new classmethod can be defined using the classmethod 
 <i>classmethod</i> (which is defined in the basic class named <i>Class</i>
 and always inherited).
 A classmethod can be invoked using the command:
 <pre>SomeClass classmethod ?...?</pre>
 Classmethods are only available to their class, and cannot be invoked
 from instances (objects) of that class.
<dt>methods
<dd>
 A method can be defined using the classmethod <i>method</i>.
 A method of a class is available to all instances (objects) of the
 class (and to the the class itself).
 A method can be invoked using a command of the form:
 <pre>pathName method ?...?</pre>
</dl>
 Methods and classmethods starting with an underscore are hidden: they
 can be invoked, but are not shown when methods are queried.
 A class can have both a method and a classmethod with the same name.
 If this is the case, the method is invoked when doing:
 <pre>pathName name ?...?</pre>
 and the classmethod is used when doing:
 <pre>ClassName name ?...?</pre>
 <p>A new object can be created using the command (classmethod <i>new</i>):
 <pre>SomeClass new object</pre>
 A new class can be created using the command (classmethod <i>subclass</i>):
 <pre>SomeClass subclass SubClass</pre>
 <h3>private variables</h3>
 Each object (or class) can store its data in private variables. A private
 variable should only be used by the object owning it. In ClassyTcl
 private variables are only protected by convention; An object or 
 function can access the private variables of another object, which is
 great for debugging. However, it is not usually good object oriented 
 programming practice to rely on this feature for your programs (data 
 encapsulation). Private variables can be accessed using the following commands:
<dl>
<dt>private object var ?var? ...
<dd>make the local variables in the list refer to the private variables of $object
<dt>setprivate object var value
<dd>set the private variable $var of object $object to $value
<dt>getprivate object var
<dd>returns the current value of the private variable $var of object $object
<dt>privatevar object var
<dd>returns the fully specified name of the private variable $var of object $object. This
can eg. be used to link a private variable to an entry:
<pre>entry .e -textvariable [privatevar someobject somevar]</pre>
</dl>


<h2>
 Classmethods
</h2>
 The classmethods defined by Class can be invoked from all classes.
<dl><b><dt>
 ClassName new <u>object</u> ?...?
</b><dd>
 create a new instance (or object) with the name $<u>object</u> of class 
 ClassName. When the actual object is created,
 the init function of class ClassName will be invoked with the arguments
 given after $<u>object</u>.<br>
 Usually, the init method of the superclass
 must be invoked somehere in the init method with appropriate parameters.
 This can be done using the command 
<pre>super ?...?</pre>.
<b><dt>
 ClassName subclass <u>SubClass</u>
</b><dd>
 create a new class named $<u>SubClass</u> that inherits data
 and methods from class ClassName. ClassName is the parent or
 superclass of SubClass.
<b><dt>
 Classname destroy
</b><dd>
 destroys a class. All its instances and subclasses and their
 instances will also be destroyed. If the classmethod destroy
 if defined for the class, it will be invoked after the 
 desctruction of its children, but before destroying the class
 itself and and its instances.
<b><dt>
 ClassName parent
</b><dd>
 returns the name of the superclass or parent of the class ClassName.
<b><dt>
 ClassName children
</b><dd>
 returns the names of all children of the class ClassName.
 These include all instances and all direct subclasses of ClassName.
<b><dt>
 ClassName method <u>name</u> <u>args</u> <u>body</u>
<br>
 ClassName method <u>pattern</u>
</b><dd>
 define a new method named $<u>name</u> for class ClassName.
 Whenever the method is invoked, the contents of body will be executed.
 The arguments <u>args</u> and <u>body</u> follow the same conventions
 as in the Tcl command proc.
<br>
 In body two extra local variables are available named class and object.
 They contain the name of respectively the class and the object that
 invoked the method. If the method was invoked from a class, the values
 of variables class and object will be identical (name of the class).
<br>
 When method is invoked without arguments, a list of all available 
 methods except the hidden methods (those starting with an underscore
 is returned. When it is invoked with one argument, a list
 of all methods matching the pattern is returned
<b><dt>
 ClassName classmethod <u>name</u> <u>args</u> <u>body</u>
<br>
 ClassName classmethod <u>pattern</u>
</b><dd>
 define a new classmethod named $<u>name</u> for class ClassName.
 Whenever the classmethod is invoked, the contents of body will be executed.
 The arguments <u>args</u> and <u>body</u> follow the same conventions
 as in the Tcl command proc.
<br>
 In body two extra local variables are available named class and object.
 Because a classmethod can only be invoked from a class, they are both
 contain the name of the class that invoked the method.
<br>
 When classmethod is invoked without arguments, a list of all available 
 classmethods except the hidden methods (those starting with an underscore)
 is returned. When it is invoked with one argument, a list
 of all classmethods matching the pattern is returned
<b><dt>
 ClassName deletemethod <u>name</u>
</b><dd>
 delete the method named $<u>name</u> from class ClassName.
 Some special methods cannot be deleted.
<b><dt>
 ClassName deleteclassmethod <u>name</u>
</b><dd>
 delete the classmethod named $<u>name</u> from class ClassName.
 Some special classmethods cannot be deleted.
<b><dt>
 ClassName private ?<u>name</u>? ?<u>value</u>?
</b><dd>
 classmethod private is used to get or change private data 
 associated with a class.
 Without arguments a list of all private class variables is returned.
 If the name argument is given, but not the value argument, the 
 current value of private class variable $<u>name</u> is returned. If both arguments
 are present, the private class variable $<u>name</u> is set to $<u>value</u>.

</dl><h2>
 Methods
</h2>
 The methods defined by Class can be invoked from all objects and classes.
<dl><b><dt>
 pathName destroy
</b><dd>
 destroys an object.
 The destroy method of the objects class (if defined) and those
 of its superclasses (if defined) will be invoked before the 
 destruction of the actual object.
<b><dt>
 pathName class
</b><dd>
 returns the class of the object given by pathName
<b><dt>
 ClassName private ?<u>name</u>? ?<u>value</u>?
</b><dd>
 private is used to get or change data associated with an object.
 Without arguments a list of all private variables is returned.
 If the name argument is given, but not the value argument, the 
 current value of private variable $<u>name</u> is returned. If both arguments
 are present, the private variable $<u>name</u> is set to $<u>value</u>.
