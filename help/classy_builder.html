<h1>ClassyTcl Builder</h1>
The ClassyTcl Builder can be used to graphically create interfaces. It 
is invoked via the <b>cbuild</b> command in the bin ClassyTcl directory.

<h2>Creating an application</h2>
You can either invoke cbuild with the name of the application you want to create,
or start cbuild without parameters. If you dont give any parameters a file 
selection dialog will be presented where you can select or type in the 
application name. If no file with this name exists, an application of that 
name will be created. An editing session will be started automatically.

<h2>Application structure</h2>
The application consists of a directory with the given name. This directory 
contains one executable script with the same name, that is used to start up 
the application. It also contains the directories lib, conf and help, that
contain code, configuration information and help files respectively. 
You may not move this executable out of the application directory;
However, symlinks to this executable will correctly start the application.
<p>
The newly created application contains one code file main.tcl with to functions:
main and mainw. The function main is called by the startup script, and should
always be present for the appliction to work. In this function, you can put
all code to initialise the application. In the new app, main only invokes 
the function mainw. The function mainw is a special function, which in the new 
app will create a toplevel with an example menu and toolbar. 

<h2>Editing an application</h2>
An editing session on an application can be started in several ways:
You can either invoke cbuild with the name of the application to be edited,
invoke cbuild without parameters, and select the application to be edited in a file 
selection dialog, or run the application with "-builder" as the first parameter.
<p>
The builder works within the program to be edited. This means that you can do 
realistic testing. So when invoking the builder on an appliction, the application 
will start up normally, but will show one window extra: the builder window. 

<h2>The builder window</h2>
By default, the builder window shows the files in the code directory of
the application. Clicking on such a file will show (or hide), the functions
in this file. Some types of functions such as dialogs and toplevels are displayed
and treated differently. Double clicking on a dialog or 
a toplevel will start the <a href="classy_windowbuilder">window builder</a>.
Double clicking on a plain function will start the function editor on this function. 
Double cliking a file will start a text editor on the entire file.
<P>
In the builder you can also remove, add, copy, paste or rename files and functions.
You can also browse and edit the configuration and help directories (from 
the File menu). The configuration dir contains several subdirectories. The init 
subdir contains the default application configuration files. The data in 
them will be edited with <a href="classy_configure">configuration dialogs</a>

<h2>Configuration settings</h2>
In the <a href="classy_configure">configuration system</a>, settings for different 
types of configuration are handled the following way:
The color, font and Misc settings are changed in the options database. You can
see the actual option Pattern by opening the "Advanced" fold. The buttons and 
entries in this fold can also be used to add, change or delete options.
The key and mouse configuration settings are changed by defining (or redefining) 
virtual events. These virtual events can be used directly by bindings in your 
application, or automatically via the <a href="widgets/DynaMenu.html">DynaMenu</a> 
system. Toolbars and Menu configurations provide the definitions for 
<a href="widgets/DynaTool.html">DynaTool</a> and 
<a href="widgets/DynaMenu.html">DynaMenu</a>.
