<I>Object system, widget set and GUI builder for Tcl</I> <BR><I>by
Peter De Rijk (Universiteit Antwerpen)</I> 

<H2>What is ClassyTcl</H2>

<H4>Object system</H3>
The first component of ClassyTcl is an <A HREF="basic/Class.html">object
system</A> for <A HREF="tcltk.html">Tcl</A>, which has both a Tcl and
a C version available. It doesn't require patches to the Tcl core,
wich makes keeping up with new releases easier. Performance is very
adequate. The C version is gives extra speed, and makes it possible
to implement some methods in C (usually also for performance
reasons).

<H3>Gui Builder</H3>
The <a href="classy_builder.html">ClassyTcl Builder</a> can be used to graphically 
create interfaces. It is invoked via the <b>cbuild</b> command in the bin
directory.

<H3>Widget Set</H3>
ClassyTcl adds a lot of improvements to Tk, ranging from <a href="widgets/DragDrop.html">drag 
and drop</a> support (between Tk apps) and a <a href="classy_configure.html">configuration 
system</a> to a large set of <A HREF="widgets/index.html">new
widgets and commands</A>, written using the object system.<br>
While the object system itself only requires Tcl (&gt;8.0), the widgets that come with it
require Tk (of course), and another freely available extension called
<A HREF="Extral.html">ExtraL</A>. ExtraL also does not require
compiled code, but can be speeded up by having it available.
Documentation for the widgets is often somewhat limited, but besides
the documentation, you can learn a lot from sources, the tests and the demos.

<H3>Sample applications</H3>
The ClassyTcl distribution contains some example applications:
<ul>
<li><b>cedit</b>: This editor is actually very useable: I use it for all my developement
<li><b>ccalc</b>: calculator; demo for the builder
<li><b>cdraw</b>: limited vector drawing program
<li><b>ctester</b>: app to test widgets
<li><b>cdemo</b>: show off
</ul>

<H2>Use</H2>
You should be able to obtain the latest versions of ClassyTcl and
ExtraL on our server <A HREF="http://rrna.uia.ac.be/">rrna.uia.ac.be</A>
via WWW or anonymous ftp (directory /pub/tcl). Both Extral and
ClassyTcl are implemented as loadable packages.
<p>
The ClassyTcl object systen can be used by putting the directories (after unpacking)
somewhere appropriate and using the command<BR>
<CODE>package require Class</CODE><br>
To use the widgets that come with the distribution, use the code:<BR>
<CODE>tk appname name<br>
package require ClassyTcl</CODE><BR>
The application name given by the "tk appname" will be
used for managing defaults and configuration options.
<p>
To write a new application, you can try out the builder by starting the program
cbuild in the bin directory.

<H2>How to contact me</H2>
My mailbox gets overwhelmed quite often, and the development of ClassyTcl 
is definately not my only task, so responses might be slower than you 
would like. However, I will respond as fast as I can.
