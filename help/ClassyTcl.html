ClassyTcl</H1>
<I>Object system for Tcl</I>
<BR><I>by Peter De Rijk (Universiteit Antwerpen)</I>
<H2>
What is ClassyTcl</H2>
ClassyTcl is an object system for <A HREF="tcltk.html">Tcl</A>, written
enirely in Tcl. This means it doesn't require patches to the Tcl core,
making keeping up with new releases easier. Performance is very adequate.
Included in the distribution is a large set of <a href="widgets/index.html">
new widgets</a>, written using
the object system. While the object system itself only requires Tcl (>8.0),
the widgets that come with it require Tk (of course), and another freely
available extension called <A HREF="Extral.html">ExtraL</A>. ExtraL also
does not require compiled code, but can be speeded up by having it available.
<H2>
Use</H2>
You should be able to obtain the latest versions of ClassyTcl and ExtraL
on our server <a href="http://rrna.uia.ac.be/">rrna.uia.ac.be</a> via WWW or 
anonymous ftp (directory /pub/tcl).
Both Extral and ClassyTcl are implemented as loadable packages. ClassyTcl
can be used by&nbsp; putting the directories (after unpacking) somewhere
appropriate and using the command
<BR>package require Class

<P>To use the widgets that come with the distribution, first use the command
<BR>classyinit &lt;program name>
<H2>
Implementation</H2>
Loading the package will create on class named <a href="basic/Class.html">
Class</a>. All other classes and objects are created by subclassing or
instanciating Class (or its subclasses), so all documentation to use the 
object system is in the description of <a href="basic/Class.html">Class</a>.
<H2>

Widgets</H2>
There are a lot of interesting <a href="widgets/index.html">widgets in 
ClassyTcl</a>, that you can use in your programs. There are complex widgets,
such as a <a href="widgets/Editor.html">full featured text editor</a>, 
a <a href="widgets/HTML.html">HTML display widget</a>,
a <a href="CmdWidget.html">console widget</a>,
a <a href="widgets/help.html">help</a> and <a href="widgets/Configurator.html">
configuration system</a> as well as component widgets, such as <a href="widgets/Dialog.html">
intelligent dialogs</a>, a <a href="widgets/NoteBook.html">NoteBook</a> or a 
<a href="widgets/Fold.html">Folding frame</a>.
Classes such as <a href="widgets/DynaMenu.html">DynaMenu</a> 
and <a href="widgets/DynaTool.html">DynaTool</a> help in easily making configurable
menus.
There are also several widgets that are improvments on the Tk widgets or systems, 
such as the <a href="widgets/Text.html">text</a> and <a href="widgets/Canvas.html">canvas</a> with 
undo capabilities and specialised entry widgets with label and contstraint options.
<p>
Unfortunately documentation is often somewhat limited, but
besides the documentation, you can learn a lot from sources. Be sure to 
check out the file '<a href="../widgets/Editor.tcl">widgets/Editor.tcl</a>' as an example. The Editor widget 
uses a lot of the other widgets.
<H2>
How to contact me</H2>
I will do my best to reply as fast as I can to any problems, etc. However,
the development of ClassyTcl is not my only task, which is why my response
might not be always as fast as you would like (although I get a good average).
