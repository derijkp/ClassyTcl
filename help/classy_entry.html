<h1>Entry field</h1>

An entry field is used to type in a value, which can be used as a parameter to some function. 
The entry field is displayed as a lowered rectangle with another color, in which the 
value appears. Clicking in the entry field puts the insertion cursor (shown as a short 
vertical line) in the entry field. Typing characters will insert these in the position 
of this cursor. This way you can then type in or correct the desired value. The current 
value can also be edited. Mouse selection also works in the entry field. Other useful (default) 
key (combinations) are: 
<pre>
Ctrl-u			remove entire value
Backspace 		delete previous character
Delete			delete next character
Home			move cursor to first character of value
End			move cursor to last character of value
</pre><p>
Some numeric entry fields, only accept numbers as input. Sometimes they even only allow 
numbers between certain boundaries. Numeric entry fields have two buttons beside them 
with an up and a down arrow. Clicking on these will increment or decrement the value in the 
numeric entry. Clicking on these while holding the 'Control' key down will change hte 
value faster. 
<p>
To the right of an entry field, there can be button with a pointing down arrow on it. Clicking 
on this brings up a menu with the <a href="peos_defaults.html">defaults</a> for this entry.
