<h1>File selection dialog</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The file selection dialog is used to select a file to be opened or used
by a program. In this dialog, you can go through the file system hierarchy. For the
selected directory or folder, a list of files present is shown of which one can be selected.
Sometimes more than one file can be selected. The actual
layout of the fileselection dialog can differ depending on the operating system the
program is running on.
<p>
The default Peos file selection dialog contains two listboxes. The left 
one contains the subdirectories in the current directory. The right one 
contains the files. Double clicking on a file will select it. Single clicking
will add it to the list in the 'File' entry under the listboxes.
The top entry labeled 'Filter' can be used to limit the
listing of files to those matching the filter.
