<h1>File save dialog</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The file save dialog is used to select a name for a file to be saved. 
The actual layout of the fileselection dialog can differ depending on 
the system the program is running on.
<p>
The default ClassyTcl file save dialog contains two listboxes. The left 
one contains the subdirectories in the current directory. The right one 
contains the files already present. Double clicking on a filename will 
select this name, and the file with this name will be overwritten. Single 
clicking will put the name in the 'File' entry under the listboxes, where 
it can be edited, before clicking the Select button, ot pressing 'Enter'.
The top entry labeled 'Filter' can be used to limit the listing of files 
to those matching the filter.
