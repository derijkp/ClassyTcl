<H1>ClassyTcl menu definition</H1>
The contents of the menus managed by <a href="widgets/DynaMenu.html">DynaMenu</a> in
<a href="ClassyTcl.html">ClassyTcl</a> are determined by a menu definition. Which
definition is used for a type of toolbar is determined in the the 
<a href="../classy_configure.html">configuration system</a>.
<p>
A menu definition consists of a number of lines. Each line specifies one menu item, 
and starts with a word describing the type of item. The rest of the line contains 
a list of parameters. If a parameter contains spaces, it must be surrounded with 
curly braces ({}) or double quotes (""). A parameter enclosed in curly braces can 
also span multiple lines. A line can be commented out by starting with a hash 
character (#). It is possible to create hierarchical menus with the type menu that 
will create submenus
The following menu item types are supported:

<h2>menu</h2>
This creates a submenu. It has the following parameters:
<ol>
<li><b>Text</b>: This text will be displayed in the menu item
<li><b>Definition</b>: The definition of what is in the submenu: This
takes the same format as the main menu
</ol>

<h2>action</h2>
This creates a menu item from which a command can be invoked. It has the 
following parameters:
<ol>
<li><b>Text</b>: This text will be displayed in the menu item
<li><b>command</b>: This command will be executed when the item is invoked. 
Each menu has an attached cmdw (commmand window) where actions invoked from the menu
will take place. If the command contains <b>%W</b> it will be replaced with the 
cmdw of the current menu. This can be necessary if one menu definition is used
for several menus, eg. a number of editor windows, where each menu should invoke
commands on the editor widget in the same window.
<li><b>?short-cut?</b>: optional key short-cut that can be used to invoke this menu 
item from the cmdw. It can either be a Tcl key event (eg. &lt;Up&gt;, &lt;Alt-a&gt;, &lt;F2&gt;) or a 
virtual event (eg. &lt;&lt;Up&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;Print&gt;&gt;).
</ol>
A typical example would be:<br>
<code>action "Save" {filesave %W} &lt;&lt;Save&gt;&gt</code>

<h2>separator</h2>
This tool takes no parameters, and just creates a separator in a menu.

<h2>check</h2>
check creates a checkbutton. This is typically used to change a variable to
an on or off value. It can also execute a command. It has the following parameters:
<ol>
<li><b>text</b>: This text will be displayed in the menu item
<li><b>options</b>: A number of options as can be given when configuring the Tcl 
checkbutton. <b>%W</b> will be replaced by the name of the cmdw of the current toolbar.
<li><b>?short-cut?</b>: optional key short-cut.
</ol>
A typical example would be:<br>
<code>check "Checked" {-variable checked -command {puts %W:$checked}}</code>

<h2>radio</h2>
radio creates a checkbutton. This is typically used to change a variable to
one of several values. It can also execute a command. It has the following parameters:
<ol>
<li><b>text</b>: This text will be displayed in the menu item
<li><b>options</b>: A number of options as can be given when configuring the Tcl 
<li><b>?short-cut?</b>: optional key short-cut.
radiobutton. <b>%W</b> will be replaced by the name of the cmdw of the current toolbar.
</ol>
A typical example would be:<br>
<code>
radio "opt1" {-variable opt -value opt1 -command {puts %W:$opt}}<br>
radio "opt2" {-variable opt -value opt2 -command {puts %W:$opt}}
</code>

<h2>activemenu</h2>
This creates a submenu that can be changed upon each
invocation. It has the following parameters:
<li><b>Text</b>: This text will be displayed in the menu item
<li><b>command</b>: This command will be executed upon each invocation of
the menu. The command should return a menu definition describing the submenu
that should be displayed.
<li><b>?short-cut?</b>: optional key short-cut.
</ol>
