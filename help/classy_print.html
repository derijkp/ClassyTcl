<H1>Print Dialog</H1>
The <a href="ClassyTcl.html">ClassyTcl</a> print dialog is used to print
something to the printer or a file. The program will generate a postscript
page with the given papersize, orientation and colormode. When "Auto scale" 
is checked, the scaling will be automatically set so
that the original page will fit entirely on the papersize given in the
print dialog. The scale can also be changed manually. Width and height must be a value
followed by c for centimeters, i for inches, m  for  millimeters, or p or nothing for
printer's points (1/72 inch).
<p>
Invoking the print button will send the postscript page to the printer using 
the print command given. The "Save" button will save the postscript in the file 
given in the entry labeled  "File".
<p>
The entries labeled "X" and "Y" specify the x and y coordinates of the left top edge 
of the area of the original that is to be printed. If the "Scaled XY" button is checked,
the coordinates given apply to the scaled original. Together with the (non automatic) 
scale these can eg. be used to print something on several pages.
<p>
"Page X" and "Page Y" determine the positioning point on the printed paper and must be 
values followed by c for centimeters, i for inches, m  for  millimeters, or p or 
nothing for printer's points (1/72 inch).
The buttons above the entry determine what part of the drawing will be positioned 
on the positioning point.
