<H1>ClassyTcl dynatool definition</H1>
The contents of the toolbars managed by <a href="widgets/DynaTool.html">DynaTool</a> in
 <a href="ClassyTcl.html">ClassyTcl</a> are determined by a toolbar definition. Which
definition is used for a type of toolbar is determined in the the <a href="../classy_configure.html">configuration 
 system</a>.
<p>
A toolbar definition consists of a number of lines. Each line specifies one tool, and starts with a word describing 
the type of tool. The rest of the line contains a list of parameters. If a parameter
contains spaces, it must be surrounded with curly braces ({}) or double quotes (""). A
parameter enclosed in curly braces can also span multiple lines. A line can be
commented out by starting with a hash character (#). If the toolbar starts with
a line "nodisplay", the toolbar will not be displayed. The following tool 
types are supported:

<h2>action</h2>
This creates a button that when clicked on will perform
some action. It has the following parameters:
<ol>
<li><b>id</b>: The button usually displays an icon. DynaMenu will try to find an icon 
of this name in the <a href="../classy_configure.html">configuration 
directories</a>. If no such icon is found, the name will be displayed as text instead.
<li><b>help</b>: This text will appear in the balloon help that will popup if the
mousepointer stays above the botton without invoking it.
<li><b>command</b>: This command will be executed when the button is invoked. Each
toolbar has an attached cmdw (commmand window) where actions invoked from the toolbar
will take place. If the command contains <b>%W</b> it will be replaced with the 
cmdw of the current toolbar. This can be necessary if one toolbar definition is used
for several toolbars, eg. a number of editor windows, where each toolbar should invoke
commands on the editor widget in the same window.
</ol>
A typical example would be:<br>
<code>action save "Save" {filesave %W}</code>

<h2>tool</h2>
This actually calls a procedure written by the developer to create any type of tool.
It only has two parameters:
<ol>
<li><b>name</b>: The name of the procdedure to call to create the tool. The procedure
will be called with one argument: the name of widget to be created. It must return a
line that can be executed to initialise the widget for an other cmdw. In this line,
%W will be replaced by the name of the cmdw before execution.
<li><b>help</b>: Text that will appear in the balloon help that will popup if the
mousepointer stays above the botton without invoking it.
</ol>
A typical example would be:<br>
<code>tool zoomtool "Zoom"</code>

<h2>separator</h2>
This tool takes no parameters, and just creates a little extra space to separate 
different bloks of tools.

<h2>check</h2>
check creates a checkbutton. This is typically used to change a variable to
an on or off value. It can also execute a command. It has the following parameters:
<ol>
<li><b>id</b>: same as above
<li><b>help</b>: same as above
<li><b>options</b>: A number of options as can be given when configuring the Tcl 
checkbutton. <b>%W</b> will be replaced by the name of the cmdw of the current toolbar.
</ol>
A typical example would be:<br>
<code>check checked "Checked" {-variable checked -command {puts %W:$checked}}</code>

<h2>radio</h2>
radio creates a checkbutton. This is typically used to change a variable to
one of several values. It can also execute a command. It has the following parameters:
<ol>
<li><b>id</b>: same as above
<li><b>help</b>: same as above
<li><b>options</b>: A number of options as can be given when configuring the Tcl 
radiobutton. <b>%W</b> will be replaced by the name of the cmdw of the current toolbar.
</ol>
A typical example would be:<br>
<code>
radio opt1 "opt1" {-variable opt -value opt1 -command {puts %W:$opt}}<br>
radio opt2 "opt2" {-variable opt -value opt2 -command {puts %W:$opt}}
</code>

<h2>widget</h2>
widget can create any widget as a tool. It has the following parameters.
<ol>
<li><b>widget command</b>: This command is invoked to create the widget. The command
will be invoked with one argument: the name of the widget to be created.
<li><b>help</b>: same as above
<li><b>options</b>: A number of options. The widget created will be configured using
these options. <b>%W</b> will be replaced by the name of the cmdw of the current toolbar.
</ol>
An example would be:<br>
<code>
widget Entry "Entry" {-command {invoke v {puts %W:$v}}}
</code>

<h2>label</h2>
creates a toollabel that just displays an icon or text. It has the following parameters.
<ol>
<li><b>id</b>: same as above
<li><b>help</b>: same as above
</ol>
A typical example would be:<br>
<code>
label label "Just a label"
</code>
