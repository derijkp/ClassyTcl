<h1>Option box</h1>
An option box contains two or more optionbuttons. Optionbuttons are used to 
select mutually exlusive options. An optionbutton is (depending on the OS) 
shown as a raised rectangular area. It contains a raised diamond on the left. 
When an option is selected, this diamond is colored. You can select one 
of several options by clicking on them with the mouse. The currently 
selected option will consequently be deslected. On the right side of 
the radiobuttons there is a short text describing the option.
