 DynaTool is not a widget and is not intended to produce instances. 
 It is a class that manages toolbars in an easy and dynamic way.
 DynaTool can handle several tooltypes.
<p>
 Each tooltype is defined by a definition in a simple format. 
 DynaTool can create one or more toolbars for each
 tooltype. When the definition of the tooltype is changed
 all toolbars of that type will be changed accordingly.
<p>
 Toolbar definitions for tooltype are usually controlled from the
 Toolbars part of the <a href="../classy_configure.html">configuration 
 system</a>. Creation of a toolbar of a certain type, will get the toolbar
 definition from the option database by creating a dummy frame with 
 class $tooltype and getting its option value for toolbar (class Toolbar).
 you can add a tooltype in the configuration system by adding
<pre>
## Sometool {this is an example toolbar} tool
option add *Sometool.Toolbar definition widgetDefault
</pre>
 to the Toolbars configuration file. You will usually only need this 
 configuration and the maketool method to get working toolbars.
<p>
 A toolbar managed by DynaTool can control several widgets: The commands 
 associated with the toolbar can include a %W, that on invocation is
 changed to the current cmdw (command widget). The cmdw of a toolbar can be
 changed at any time.

<dl><b><dt>
pathname maketool tooltype tool cmdw
</b><dd>
 create a toolbar of type $tooltype. $cmdw
 determines the initial commmand widget.

<b><dt>
pathname define tooltype ?data?
</b><dd>
 set the definition describing the tools that will be generated 
 for $tooltype.
 If data is not given, the toolbar definition for $tooltype is obtained 
 from the option database. A dummy frame with class $tooltype is created,
 and the its option value for toolbar (class Toolbar) obtained. This option
 will usually be set in the Toolbars part 
 <a href="../classy_configure.html">configuration system</a>.
 You will usually not invoke this method, as the maketool
 method will automatically define a tooltype that isn't managed yet.

<b><dt>
pathname names 
</b><dd>

<b><dt>
pathname redraw tooltype
</b><dd>
 redraw toolbars of type $tooltype

<b><dt>
pathname get tooltype
</b><dd>
 returns the definition of $tooltype

<b><dt>
pathname deletetool tool
</b><dd>
 delete $tool managed by DynaTool

<b><dt>
pathname delete tooltype
</b><dd>
 delete the definition and all toolbars of $tooltype

<b><dt>
pathname cmdw tool {cmdw {}}
</b><dd>
 change the current cmdw for $tool to $cmdw. If the cmdw argument is
 not given, the method returns the current cmdw for $tool.
 This method is automatically called when a widget which has bindtags
 defined by DynaTool recieves the focus.

<b><dt>
pathname invoke curtool index
</b><dd>
 invoke the item given by $index in $curtool

<b><dt>
pathname conftool tooltype
</b><dd>

<b><dt>
pathname reqwidth tool
</b><dd>

<b><dt>
pathname reqheight tool
</b><dd>
