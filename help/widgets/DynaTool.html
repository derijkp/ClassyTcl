 The DynaTool widgets are toolbars, for which the contents are managed by
 the DynaTool class in an easy and dynamic way.
 DynaTool can handle several tooltypes.
<p>
 Each tooltype is defined by a <a href="../classy_dynatool.html">definition in a simple format</a>. 
 DynaTool can create one or more toolbars for each
 tooltype. When the definition of the tooltype is changed
 all toolbars of that type will be changed accordingly.
<p>
 Toolbar definitions for tooltype are usually controlled from the
 Toolbars part of the <a href="../classy_configure.html">configuration 
 system</a>.
<p>
 A toolbar managed by DynaTool can control several widgets: The commands 
 associated with the toolbar can include a %W, that on invocation is
 changed to the current cmdw (command widget). The cmdw of a toolbar can be
 changed at any time.

<dl><b><dt>
pathname define tooltype ?data?
</b><dd>
 set the <a href="../classy_dynatool.html">definition describing the tools</a> that will be generated 
 for $tooltype.
 If data is not given, the toolbar definition for $tooltype will be returned.
 Definition of toolbars is usually done in the
 <a href="../classy_configure.html">configuration system</a>.
 You will usually not invoke this method, as the definition of 
 tooltype that isn't managed yet will be automatically fetched and defined
 when creating a new toolbar.

<b><dt>
pathname redraw tooltype
</b><dd>
 redraw toolbars of type $tooltype

<b><dt>
pathname types ?pattern? 
</b><dd>

<b><dt>
pathname get tooltype
</b><dd>
 returns the definition of $tooltype

<b><dt>
pathname deletetool tool
</b><dd>
 delete $tool managed by DynaTool

<b><dt>
pathname delete tooltype
</b><dd>
 delete the definition and all toolbars of $tooltype

<b><dt>
pathname cmdw tool {cmdw {}}
</b><dd>
 change the current cmdw for $tool to $cmdw. If the cmdw argument is
 not given, the method returns the current cmdw for $tool.

<b><dt>
pathname invoke curtool index
</b><dd>
 invoke the item given by $index in the tool

<b><dt>
pathname reqwidth tool
</b><dd>

<b><dt>
pathname reqheight tool
</b><dd>
