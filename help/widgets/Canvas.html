 Classy::Canvas creates a canvas widget that supports undo and redo, 
 save and load, selection and grouping. Most options
 and commands are identical to those of the standard Tk canvas.<br>
 Classy::Canvas reserves tags starting with an underscore (_) for internal
 use (temporary tags, grouping etc.). You should not add or remove such tags, 
 except for the group names returned by the group method.
 they should be ignored
