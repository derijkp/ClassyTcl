 Dialog produces "intelligent" dialog. They have a simple option to
make them resizable or not. They automatically assume a reasonable
minimum size based on their content (The dialog will be placed on the
screen and its size calculated at the first idle moment after dialog 
creation. The dialog will place itself so that the mouse pointer is 
is positioned over it, without being placed partly out of the screen.
If it is resized, it remembers its size for the next display.
<p>
By default, the dialog has a "Close" button that destroys the dialog
on invocation. Other buttons can be added easily using the add method.
Invoking a command by clicking on a button (or using a key shortcut)
will close the dialog, unless the button is persistent, or was 
invoked using the Adjust mouse button.
The dialog has one component named options, which is a frame in
which optionmenus, entries, etc. can be placed.
