 DynaMenu is not a widget and is not intended to produce instances. 
 It is a class that manages menus in an easy and dynamic way.
 Dynamenu can handle several menutypes.
<p>
 Each menutype is defined by a definition in a simple format. 
 Dynamenu can create one or more popup or top menus for each
 menutype. When the definition of the menutype is redefined
 all menus of that type will be changed accordingly.
<p>
 Menu definitions for menutype are usually controlled from the
 Menus part of the <a href="../classy_configure.html">configuration 
 system</a>. Creation of a menu of a certain type, will get the menu
 definition from the option database by creating a dummy frame with 
 class menutype and getting its option value for menu (class Menu).
 you can add a menutype in the configuration system by adding
<pre>
## Somemenu {this is an example menu} menu
option add *Somemenu.Menu definition widgetDefault
</pre>
 to the Menus configuration file. You will usually only need this 
 configuration and the makemenu method to get working menus.
<p>
 A menu managed by DynaMenu can control several widgets: The commands 
 associated with the menu can include a %W, that on invocation is
 changed to the current cmdw (command widget). The cmdw of a menu can be
 changed at any time. DynaMenu also handles key shortcuts.

<dl><b><dt>
DynaMenu makemenu menutype menu cmdw bindtag ?menuroot?
</b><dd>
 This is usually the only method you need to create menus. It
 creates a menu named $menu of type $menutype if $menu does not exist yet.
 $cmdw determines the initial command widget. All key bindings 
 from key shortcuts
 are bound to $bindtag. Adding $bindtag to the bindtags of a widget
 will make all shortcuts available from that widget.
 The menu created will be a popup or top menu depending
 on the <a href="../classy_configure.html">ClassyTcl configuration</a>.
 <br>menuw can optionally be given to give the window on wich to tag 
 a menubar. If not given the toplevel of the cmdw is used. In this case,
 the cmdw has to exist when the menu is made.

<b><dt>
DynaMenu makepopup menu curmenu data cmdw bindtag
</b><dd>
 create a popup menu by the definition given in data. $cmdw
 determines the initial cmdw. All key bindings for key shortcuts
 are bound to $bindtag. Adding $bindtag to the bindtags of a widget
 will make all shortcuts available from that widget.

<b><dt>
DynaMenu define menutype ?data?
</b><dd>
 set the definition describing the menus that will be generated 
 for menutype to $data.
 If data is not given, the menu definition for menutype is obtained 
 from the option database. A dummy frame with class $menutype is created,
 and the its option value for menu (class Menu) obtained. This option
 will usually be set in the Menus part 
 <a href="../classy_configure.html">configuration system</a>.
 You will usually not invoke this method, as the maketop and 
 makepopup methods will automatically define a menutype
 that isn't managed yet.

<b><dt>
DynaMenu names 
</b><dd>
 returns a list of menutypes managed by Dynamenu

<b><dt>
DynaMenu menus menutype
</b><dd>
 returns a list of menus of type $menutype managed by Dynamenu

<b><dt>
DynaMenu get menutype
</b><dd>
 returns the definition of $menutype

<b><dt>
DynaMenu delete menutype
</b><dd>
 delete the definition and all menus of $menutype

<b><dt>
DynaMenu cmdw menu ?cmdw?
</b><dd>
 change the current cmdw for menu to $cmdw. If the cmdw argument is
 not given, the method returns the current cmdw for menu.
 This method is automatically called when a widget which has bindtags
 defined by DynaMenu recieves the focus.

<b><dt>
DynaMenu post menu ?x y?
</b><dd>
 post menu

<b><dt>
DynaMenu invoke curmenu index
</b><dd>
 invoke the item given by $index in $curmenu

<b><dt>
DynaMenu confmenu menutype
</b><dd>
