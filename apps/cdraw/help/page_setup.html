<h1>Page Setup</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The page setup dialog is used to change the current paper size, orientation 
and color.

<h2>Options</h2>

<h3>Paper color</h3>
Change the color of the paper

<h3>Paper size</h3>
This dialog defines the size of the paper to work on. This papersize does not
have to be the same size as the final printout. For printing everything
will be scaled to an appropriate size. In fact, for large structures
it is often better to select a larger size.
The standard papersizes can be selected from 
the <a href="classy_optionmenu.html">optionmenu</a> to 
the right. Non standard paper sizes can be entered in the 'Width' and 
'Height' <a href="classy_entry.html>entries</a>.

<h3>Orientation</h3>
<a href="classy_optionbox.html>Optionbox</a>:
The paper can be oriented either with the long side vertical (Portrait) or
horizontal (Landscape).
