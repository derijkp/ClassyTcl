<h2>Description</h2>
While laying out the structure, elements of single stranded areas might 
move of the page. To easily get them back, the 'Control single' 
dialog can be used. It presents a list of all single stranded areas. One
of these can be selected and either straightened (all elements will form
a straight line from start- to endpoint) or arched.
