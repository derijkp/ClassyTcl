<h1>Drawing objects</h1>
In RnaViz you can draw several types of objects (rectangles, text, lines, 
polygons and ovals). Drawing one of these objects is started from the "Mode
menu". (They temporarilly change the way mouse and keybindings work.)
<p>
These objects can be selected, moved, rotated and configured just like the
objects constituting the structure. Dragging the top-left or bottom-right 
edge of a rectangle will change its size. Dragging an edge of a line or
polygon will change the position of the edge instead of that of the 
entire object.
<p>
Selecting the object and invoking the "Delete object" option in the "Edit"
menu will delete the object.
