<h1>Skeleton file</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
When creating structure drawings for several similar molecules, it is not
necessary to redo the layout for each molecule. In stead the layout of one
molecule can be saved in a skeleton file. This file will contain the 
starting positions and orientation of all helices and helix numbers. This
skeleton can afterwards be applied to other drawings.
<P>
The use of skeleton files makes it very easy to create a lot of drawings 
using the same layout. Since RnaViz does not try to produce non overlapping 
drawings, a structure drawing produced without using a matching skeleton 
file will take more manual rearrangements afterwards.
<p>
A <a href="howto-createaskeleton.html">skeleton file can be created</a> 
from an existing structure drawing.
