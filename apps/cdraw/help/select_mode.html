<h2>The selection</h2>
The user can select the current object by clicking on it. The current object
will be displayed in red with a blue bounding rectangle. Depending on the 
selection mode (see further), other objects than the current one will also 
be selected. The selection (selected objects) are also diplayed in red, but 
with a red bounding rectangle. Objects can be added or removed from
the selection by clicking while the "Control" is pressed. Dragging the pointer
over the page, will select the objects enclosed in the rectangle shown.
Some actions will be limited either to the current object or to the selected
objects (selection).
<p>
In the selection mode, the points defining the current object are highlighted 
and can be edited (line containing items). New points can be added by double 
clicking on a line.
