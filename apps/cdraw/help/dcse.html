<h1>DCSE</h1>

<h2>What is DCSE</h2>
DCSE (Dedicated Comparative Sequence Editor) is a multiple alignment
editor. It can be used to edit protein, DNA or RNA alignments. The
structure of the molecules can be incorporated in the alignment. It is
written in C, and it uses dynamic memory for most things. This means
you can almost edit any size of alignment with it. It offers lots of
features such as color display of characters and structure, automatic
alignment relative to sequences already aligned with others, sequence
grouping, sequence or pattern searching, marker system, checking of
incorporated RNA structure, on-line hypertext help, macros, and a lot
more.

<h2>The DCSE alignment file</h2>
DCSE v.3 stores alignment and structure information in plain ASCII files 
in a certain format. These files are usually given the extension ".ali".
The alignment in an alignment files can be edited Using DCSE. To create 
an alignment file or append sequences to an existing alignment, the 
complementary program Convers can be used.

<h2>The DCSE alignment format</h2>

An alignment file starts with four info lines followed by several 
sequence lines. The first info line shows two numbers: the first position shown in the 
alignment, and the last position. For DCSE, the difference between the two must 
be equal to the number of positions in the alignment. RnaViz does not use these numbers,
so for RnaViz any two numbers would do.
The positions can be preceded by a 'P' for a 
protein alignment, a 'D' for a DNA alignment or an 'R' for an RNA alignment. When none of 
these are present, the alignment is supposed to be an RNA alignment. The other info lines 
can contain any text. The second info line is usually empty. The third and fourth line 
usually contain an indication of the position. A sequence line consists of the entire 
sequence (including gaps), followed by a space, a number of five characters long, 
another space, and the species name of maximum 40 characters. The number is not 
essential, the number of characters between the sequence and its name however has to be 
7. All sequences should have equal length. Each sequence line consists of symbols for 
nucleotides or gaps, alternated with positions that are either blank or contain 
special symbols, e.g. symbols delimiting secondary structure elements. 

<h2>Symbols describing secondary structure</h2>
The following symbols are used to indicate secondary structure elements.:
<pre>
 [ and ] : beginning and end of one strand of a helix.
 ^     	 : symbolizes ][, a new helix starting immediately after the previous one.
 { and } : beginning and end of an internal loop or bulge loop interrupting a helix strand.
 ( and ) : enclose a base forming part of a non-standard pair (any pair other than G.C, A.U, or G.U).
</pre>

<h2>Helix numbering</h2>
To allow the identification of secondary structure elements, "helix numbering lines" 
are intercalated between the sequences. The name of such lines must begin with "Helix 
numbering". These lines contains the helix names, but have otherwise an empty sequence 
(only gap characters). The 5'- and 3'- strand of a helix name are indicated as 
&lt;name&gt; and &lt;name&gt;'.
<p>
<b>RnaViz is more picky about the position of the helix names that DCSE</b>: the helix 
name used is the first one on the helix numbering line after the postion where
the strand of the helix is opened. (DCSE did check the strands before and after
the helix name; this will also change in future versions of DCSE.)
