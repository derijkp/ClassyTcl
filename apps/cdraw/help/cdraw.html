<h1>cdraw</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
cdraw is a simple vector drawing program serving as a demo of the capabilities
of <a href="ClassyTcl">ClassyTcl</a>. It is however generally useful.

<h2>Starting cdraw</h2>
Starting cdraw will display a page surrounded by scroll bars, a menu, 
a <a href="main_toolbar.html">main toolbar</a>, 
a <a href="secondary_toolbar.html">secondary toolbar</a> 
and a <a href="sidebar.html">sidebar</a>.
All functions in cdraw can be started from the menu, or using 
user-defineable key-shortcuts. Often used functions can be started from the
toolbars. The menu and the key-shortcuts can be 
<a href="classy_configure.html">completely customised</a>.

<h2>Opening files</h2>
The file menu contains an 'Open' entry. This will open a file selection box,
in which a file to be loaded can be specified.
To remove all structures from the page the 'Clear Page' option in the File 
menu can be used.

<h2>Functions and options</h2>
An overview of the functions found in RnaViz can be found in 
the <a href="contents.html">contents</a>.

<h2>Implementation</h2>
cdraw is implemented in <a href="tcltk.html">Tcl/Tk</a>, and relies on 
the <a href="Extral.html">Extral</a> and <a href="ClassyTcl.html">ClassyTcl</a> extensions.
