<h2>Introduction</h2>
In short, RnaViz is a program that allows you to create 2D drawings
of the structure embedded in a <a href="dcse.html">DCSE alignment 
file</a> or a ct file. The layout of one drawing can be transfered to
another drawing using skeleton files. Basic skeleton files are 
provided with the program for several molecules (5S, SSU, LSU, tRNA, Intron).
The drawings can also be annotated easily.
<p>
The easiest help to get you started with RnaViz is 
the <a href="howto.html">tutorial or howto section</a> of the help files.
It describes how to do most common tasks in RnaViz in a "cookbook" style.
<p>
You can find more general information about what RnaViz is and does
in the <a href="rnaviz.html">general RnaViz help section</a> and in 
the <a href="rnaviz-article.html">RnaViz article Text</a>. Specific 
descriptions of all the options can be found in 
the <a href="contents.html">contents</a>.
