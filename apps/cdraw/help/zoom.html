<h1>Zoom mode</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The drawing can be displayed (and edited) in a different size than it actually
is. The drawing can be magified (zooming in; value larger than 100%) to work on 
specific details or zoomed out (smaller value) to get an overview. Zooming 
out is limited to 20%. 

<h2>Zooming with the pointer</h2>
In zoom mode you can select an area to zoom into by dragging with the pointer.
Clicking on the page will zoom out.

<h2>Zoom toolbar</h2>
In zoom mode the secondary toolbar will show several preset zoom 
percentages that can be chosen by clicking. You can also enter a specific zoom value
in the entry in this zoom toolbar.
