<h1>Geometry toolbar</h1>

Menu: Geometry.Geometry toolbar

<h2>Description</h2>
Using the buttons on this <a href="secondary_toolbar.html">secondary toolbar</a>, 
the current helix (this is the one containing the current object) can be 
oriented in a given direction. The toolbar can be selected using the 
"Geometry.Geometry toolbar" menu, or the "Geometry toolbar" button on the
<a href="main_toolbar.html">Main toolbar</a>

<h2>Entries</h2>
The 'Angle' <a href="classy_entry.html">entry</a> determines
the new angle. The angle is 0 for a horizontal helix that is oriented to
the right. The buttons labeled with an arrow pointing e, ne, n, nw, w, sw, s 
and se will point the helix to that direction. If other objects than the 
helix are selected (eg. the tree enclosed by the helix segments) these 
will be rotated by the same amount as necessary to orient the current helix 
in the given direction.
