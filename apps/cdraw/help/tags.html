<h2>Description</h2>

A tag is a short text that is
attached to the object. Every object can have several tags. The tags
attached to an object can be changed individually by selecting the
object and changing them in the entry labeled "Tags" in the Properties toolbar. 
If the structure was created starting from a DCSE alignement that contained
a line named "mask" each base is tagged with the letter on the corresponding
position in the "mask" line. It is also possible to add a list of tags
to the sequence. 
<p>
Tags are a very powerful feature: they can be used to indicate any
special feature of specific bases, such as the variability of their
position or their use in a certain analysis. Since object configuration
can be limited to objects with certain tags, it is very easy to display
such bases using different colors or fonts.
