<h2>Flip helix</h2>
The same helix can be drawn in two different ways on the page (mirror
images). A helix drawn one way, cannot be changed to the other using 
rotation. The flip option will flip the helix to its mirror image.
The latter is often necessary to create a clear drawing of pseudo knots.

<h2>Flip drawing</h2>
The structure models are by default drawn clockwise. You can flip the
entrire drawing so that is drawn counter-clockwise.
