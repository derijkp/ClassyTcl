Menu:options.Connect bases<br>
Tcl routine:connect<br>
<p>
Select a base, then invoke the "Connect bases" entry in the "Options" menu.
You will be prompted for the base to which the previous base should be 
connected. Once you have selected this, a line will be drawn between the 
two bases. This line will be redrawn when the bases are repositioned. It
can be configured using the normal <a href="properties_toolbar.html">object
properties toolbar</a>.
<p>
Clicking on the line and dragging will add an edge to the line, which can 
be repositioned (and deleted). The connection can be deleted by selecting it,
and invoking the "Delete object" option in the "Edit menu".
