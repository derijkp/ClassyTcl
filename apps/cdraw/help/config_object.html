Menu:Options.Configure objects<br>
Tcl routine:objectconfigure<br>

<h2>Description</h2>
Each object has properties such as font, text, color, linewidth and
position. The "Configure Objects" dialog offers a versatile interface
to change these properties for any object or groups of objects. Several
parameters can be set that limit property changes to objects fullfilling
certain criteria. The most common method is to only change the properties
of the currently selected objects or of the current drawing. Property
changes can also be limited to a specific type of objects such as bases,
base pairings, base numbers, helix names or labels. 
<p>
The top part of the dialog is used to 
select which objects the options will be applied to. 
The bottom part contains the options that might be changed.

<h2>Object selection</h2>
All actions will be applied to objects fulfilling the selection
parameters given by the
two <a href="classy_optionmenu.html">optionmenus</a> and 
and <a href="classy_entry.html">entry</a> labeled 'Tags'.
in the top part of the dialog.
<br>
The first option menu limits the scope to either the currently 
selected object alone (Selection), the currently selected structure
drawing (Drawing) or everything on the page (All).
<br>
The second optionmenu limits the action to certain types of
objects, eg. only the bases or only the helixnames.
<br>
The 'Tags' entry limits the action to those objects containing all of 
the <a href="tags.html">tags</a> given in the entry.
<br>
The action will only be applied to objects fulfilling all these parameters.

<h2>Options</h2>
All options can be applied by typing in a new value and pressing the 
'Enter' key (or using the buttons labeled 'Select').
<dl>
<dt>Fill color (<a href="classy_entry.html">entry</a>)<dd>
changes the main color of the objects. The button labeled 'Select' allows
the user to select colors by example, or using RGB or HSV color selection.
<dt>Outline color (<a href="classy_entry.html">entry</a>)<dd>
If an object has an outline (rectangle, oval), this entry will change
the color of this outline. As above, the selection of color can be done
easier using the 'Select' button.
<dt>Font (<a href="classy_entry.html">entry</a>)<dd>
changes the font of the objects.
<dt>Text (<a href="classy_entry.html">entry</a>)<dd>
changes the text for matching text objects.

<dt>Add tags (<a href="classy_entry.html">entry</a>)<dd>

<dt>Delete tags (<a href="classy_entry.html">entry</a>)<dd>
