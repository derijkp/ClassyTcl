ClassyTcl

Object system, widget set and GUI builder for Tcl
by Peter De Rijk (Universiteit Antwerpen)

What is ClassyTcl
-----------------

ClassyTcl is a dynamically loadable object system for Tcl. A 
Tcl-only as well as a C implementation 
is available. It also doesn't require patches to the Tcl core, so
keeping up with new releases should be easy. Performance is very
adequate. The C version is gives extra speed, and makes it possible
to implement some methods in C.

In contrast to other Tcl object systems for Tcl, it is not modeled after 
the object system designed for a completely different language such a C. 
IMHO, it better follows the Tcl philosophy. The system is simple, but 
flexible. Classes and objects are dynamic, and can easily be queried, 
changed and debugged at runtime.

Installation
------------
You should be able to obtain the latest version of ClassyTcl
via www on url http://rrna.uia.ac.be/classytcl/ or via anonymous ftp
on rrna.uia.ac.be. in the directory /pub/tcl

Binary packages

A binary ClassyTcl package can be "installed" by placing it where Tcl can find
it. A binary package does not necesarily contain compiled code: If no 
compiled version (.so, .dll) is available, a Tcl-only version will be used.

Sources

The Tcl script makedist.tcl creates a package distribution. If no compiled 
version (.so, .dll) is available, a Tcl-only version will be created.

Compiled packages for most Unix platform should be created using the following 
steps:
cd ClassyTcl/build
./configure
make
make install

Use
---

The ClassyTcl object systen can be used by putting the directories (after
unpacking) somewhere appropriate and using the command
package require ClassyTcl
This will add one command (and a namespace) named Class, that forms the 
basis of ClassyTcl.

Porting to other platforms
--------------------------
The Tcl version should work anywhere Tcl works. The Tcl version will
be used when no shared object file or dll is found. You can create
binaries for other Unix platforms using the following steps:
cd ClassyTcl/build
./configure
make

Contributions
-------------

If you have fixed bugs, made some nice additions to ClassyTcl widgets, etc.,
you can send them to me, and I will consider incorporating them in new
releases.

How to contact me
-----------------

My mailbox gets overwhelmed quite often, and the development of ClassyTcl is
definately not my only task, so responses might be slower than you would
like. However, I will respond as fast as I can.
