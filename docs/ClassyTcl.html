<I>Object system for Tcl</I> <BR><I>by

<H2>What is ClassyTcl</H2>

<H4>Object system</H3>
ClassyTcl is a dynamically loadable 
<A HREF="classy_object_system.html">object system</A> for 
<A HREF="tcltk.html">Tcl</A>. A Tcl-only as well as a C implementation 
is available. It also doesn't require patches to the Tcl core, so
keeping up with new releases should be easy. Performance is very
adequate. The C version is gives extra speed, and makes it possible
to implement some methods in C.
<br>
In contrast to other Tcl object systems for Tcl, it is not modeled after 
the object system designed for a completely different language such a C. 
IMHO, it better follows the Tcl philosophy. The system is simple, but 
flexible. Classes and objects are dynamic, and can easily be queried, 
changed and debugged at runtime.

<H2>Use</H2>
You should be able to obtain the latest versions of 
<A HREF="https://github.com/derijkp/ClassyTcl/">ClassyTcl</a> and
<A HREF="https://github.com/derijkp/Extral">ExtraL</a>
Both Extral and ClassyTcl are implemented as loadable packages.
<p>
The ClassyTcl object systen can be used by putting the directories 
(after unpacking and optionally compiling)
somewhere appropriate and using the command<BR>
<CODE>package require Class</CODE><br>
This will add one command (and a namespace) named <a href="Class.html">Class</a>, 
that forms the basis of ClassyTcl.

<H2>Contributions</H2>
If you have fixed bugs, made some nice additions, etc.,
you can send them to me, and I will consider incorporating them in new
releases.

<H2>How to contact me</H2>
My mailbox gets overwhelmed quite often, and the development of ClassyTcl 
is definately not my only task, so responses might be slower than you 
would like. However, I will respond as fast as I can.
