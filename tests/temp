Object system for Tcl 
by Peter De Rijk (Universiteit Antwerpen) 

What is ClassyTcl
ClassyTcl is an object system for Tcl, written enirely in Tcl. This means it doesn't require patches to the Tcl core, making keeping up with new releases easier. Performance is very adequate. Included in the distribution is a large set of  new widgets, written using the object system. While the object system itself only requires Tcl (>8.0), the widgets that come with it require Tk (of course), and another freely available extension called ExtraL. ExtraL also does not require compiled code, but can be speeded up by having it available. 

Use
You should be able to obtain the latest versions of ClassyTcl and ExtraL on our server rrna.uia.ac.be via WWW or anonymous ftp (directory /pub/tcl). Both Extral and ClassyTcl are implemented as loadable packages. ClassyTcl can be used by  putting the directories (after unpacking) somewhere appropriate and using the command 
package require Class 

To use the widgets that come with the distribution, first use the command 
classyinit <program name> 

Implementation
Loading the package will create on class named  Class. All other classes and objects are created by subclassing or instanciating Class (or its subclasses), so all documentation to use the object system is in the description of Class. 

Widgets
There are a lot of interesting widgets in ClassyTcl, that you can use in your programs. There are complex widgets, such as a full featured text editor, a HTML display widget, a console widget, a help and  configuration system as well as component widgets, such as  intelligent dialogs, a NoteBook or a Folding frame. Classes such as DynaMenu and DynaTool help in easily making configurable menus. There are also several widgets that are improvments on the Tk widgets or systems, such as the text and canvas with undo capabilities and specialised entry widgets with label and contstraint options. 

Unfortunately documentation is often somewhat limited, but besides the documentation, you can learn a lot from sources. Be sure to check out the file 'widgets/Editor.tcl' as an example. The Editor widget uses a lot of the other widgets. 

How to contact me
I will do my best to reply as fast as I can to any problems, etc. However, the development of ClassyTcl is not my only task, which is why my response might not be always as fast as you would like (although I get a good average).  Peter De Rijk
