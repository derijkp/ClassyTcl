Only large and incompatible changes with regard to previous 
versions are listed here:

Class
-----
- only classmethods can be invoked from a class
- the init method used to initialise a new object used to be
  defined as a classmethod, now as a method (is more logical)


ClassyTcl
---------
- The configuration system has been entirely redone, mainly for 
  performance reasons
