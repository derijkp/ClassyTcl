Only large and incompatible changes with regard to previous 
versions are listed here:

The former ClassyTcl has been split in to packages: ClassyTcl and ClassyTk

ClassyTcl contains only the object system
ClassyTk contains the rest (widgets, GUI builder)

Class
-----
- only classmethods can be invoked from a class
- the init method used to initialise a new object used to be
  defined as a classmethod, now as a method (is more logical)
